# A Time-Series-Regression-Analysis-The-Corporation-Favorita-Project
## Introduction
As a data scientist at Corporation Favorita, a leading grocery retailer in Ecuador, the primary objective is to ensure optimal inventory management by accurately predicting the demand for products across various store locations. To achieve this goal, the project involves employing time series regression analysis techniques to develop robust machine learning models. By leveraging historical sales data and other relevant features, the aim is to forecast future unit sales for thousands of items stocked at Favorita stores.

## Project Scenario
You are a data scientist in Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. Corporation Favorita wants to ensure that they always have the right quantity of products in stock. To do this you have decided to build a series of machine learning models to forecast the demand of products in various locations. The marketing and sales team have provided you with some data to aid this endeavor. Your team uses CRISP-DM Framework for Data Science projects. This is a time series regression analysis problem. In this project, you'll predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. Specifically, you are to build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores. 

## Project Scope
The scope of the project encompasses the development of predictive models tailored to individual store locations within Corporation Favorita's retail network. These models will utilize a variety of time series regression algorithms to forecast unit sales for diverse product categories. Additionally, the project will involve exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. By leveraging advanced time series regression analysis techniques, this project aims to empower Corporation Favorita with actionable insights for optimizing inventory levels and meeting customer demand effectively. The successful implementation of predictive models will contribute to the company's strategic objectives and competitive advantage in the retail market.

## Methodology
The project will adhere to the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, encompassing the following stages:

* Business Understanding: Gain insights into Corporation Favorita's inventory management goals and requirements.
* Data Understanding: Explore and understand the structure, quality, and relationships within the provided dataset.
* Data Preparation: Preprocess the data, handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and prepare it for modeling.
* Modeling: Develop time series regression models using appropriate algorithms such as ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet.
* Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).
* Deployment: Deploy the finalized model(s) to generate forecasts for future sales data, which can be integrated into Corporation Favorita's inventory management system.

## Expected Outcome
* Accurate forecasts of unit sales for various items across Favorita stores.
* Improved inventory management efficiency and reduction in stockouts or overstock situations.
* Enhanced decision-making capabilities for marketing and sales teams based on predictive insights.

## Answering the Analytical Questions
1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year (excluding days the store was closed)?
3. Compare the sales for each month across the years and determine which month of which year had the highest sales.
4. Did the earthquake impact sales?
5. Are certain stores or groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)
6. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
7. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?
8. Which product family and stores did the promotions affect.
9. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)
10. Does the payment of wages in the public sector on the 15th and last days of the month influence the store sales.
